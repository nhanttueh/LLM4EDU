            "content": "The \"White Collar Bloodbath\" isn't coming, it's here...\n\nSeveral top economic researchers, including Tom Cunningham, recently resigned from OpenAI. Allegations that the research team was becoming a \"propaganda arm\" rather than a source of truth.The internal data shows we are effectively replacing the entry level employee. The hiring stats back this up too as there is a massive drop in employment for people under twenty five.\n\nThe \"grunt work\", the tasks we used to give juniors so they could learn the ropes, make mistakes, and grow into seniors is disappearing. The AI is doing it faster, cheaper, and now, often better. The new GPT 5.2 numbers show it is building complex workforce planning models and leveraged buyouts that aren't just accurate but are actually preferred by hiring managers. These are blind tests by veterans with over a decade of experience at major banks and tech firms. They picked the AI output 60% of the time...60% of the time it works every time.\n\nIf you are 30+, you are somewhat safe for now if you embrace AI. You have the context and the expertise to direct the AI..but the youngins are screwed.\n\nthere's going to be blood on the streets pretty soon...and it's about it get ugly.",

            "content": "Agents, prompts, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) represent complementary approaches within the evolving landscape of AI and natural language processing. Agents—autonomous or semi-autonomous systems built on large language models—extend the capabilities of LLMs by enabling multi-step reasoning, task execution, and interaction with external tools or environments. By structuring interactions as a sequence of actions, agents provide a framework for bridging natural language understanding with goal-directed behavior, raising questions about planning, decision-making, and context management in artificial systems.\r\n\r\nPrompts serve as the interface between human intent and model behavior, shaping outputs through carefully designed instructions or exemplars. The study of prompt engineering highlights the sensitivity of LLMs to input phrasing and the potential for nuanced control over generated responses, while also revealing limitations in robustness, interpretability, and bias propagation.\r\n\r\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge sources with language models, allowing systems to access up-to-date, domain-specific, or factual information during generation. By combining retrieval mechanisms with generative capabilities, RAG addresses key limitations of LLMs, such as hallucination and outdated knowledge, while opening avenues for more reliable, contextually grounded AI applications.\r\n\r\nTogether, these developments underscore a shift from static, pre-trained models to interactive, knowledge-integrated systems. They prompt critical questions about evaluation standards, epistemic reliability, and the balance between autonomous reasoning and human oversight in AI systems. Exploring agents, prompts, and RAG in tandem provides a conceptual and practical framework for understanding the next generation of intelligent, adaptable, and context-aware language technologies.",

Spread the word: never mention or cite McKinsey, it is The  most notoriously detached from reality agency, thriving out of unbelievably huge consulting contracts worth billions with largest corporations, to publish reports with what they think might be shocking enough to seem worth the extracted billions, but in the end making those corporations to disrupt their own employees, instead of competition -b.t.w. \"disruption\" is an effect, not a cause, and chasing an effect will depart you from ever achieving it. Instead, it just brings all the drama inside the house. McKinsey's conclusions are always most imaginative justifications for restructuring or resource actions in the name of some trendy experiment, which smaller companies abandon immediately. McKinsey knows very well that shortly after, the company will look more profitable. \n In the given example with the credit analyst did it ever cross your mind that it could take actually 10 steps x 1 minute = 10 minutes + 10 minutes for filling the gaps in a prefilled template for the memo? In total 20 minutes of effective work, and not two weeks, but there are lags between steps for processing external checks which are future legality provisions, allowing the RM in the meantime to processes in parallel other couple hundreds of credit applications in these 2 weeks? What proof do you need more for how detached from reality is McKinsey, when it 'approximates\" 20 minutes to 2 weeks?\nSmall firms can fail fast and course correct even faster, bad news spread like fire. If a large corporation announced the adoption it takes 4 years to do it. Smaller companies already abandoned the trend 4 years ago, and in the meantime found their own path which usually combines what they did well before the trend with something else which doesn't even have a name yet. Of course in the very short term, these resource actions will make the large business look more profitable than before, only to fail miserably a couple of months later, and we all know why: even if best people leave first when drama is brought into the house, as it's incompatible with steady creation, learning and growth, businesses seem to continue working as usual for a while, out of inertia or large mass momentum, only to start showing huge cracks a couple of months later, and corporations desperately seeking buyers for entire departments which were working well before the \"optimizations\", just not the best, or not \"disruptive\" enough.",

One question I do have is whether creating a chain of complex prompts is better than using the Chain of Thought? I understand that breaking the complex prompt into steps of prompts is easier for debugging, but which one is better? Also, I have watched all the lectures so far on Stanford CS230 - Autumn 2025, and it is amazing and useful to have a general, updated, and professional study of Deeping Learning as it is the beginning and a great starting point as a new PhD student. But I am hoping Lectures 8, 9, and 10 will be released.",

MCP itself is a security and token bloating nightmare, not thinking about contractual obligations.\n\nAlso factual: what if MCP gets substituted? At one time you have to get to the bottom line and be as specific as possible. And what makes a model “reasoning of the abstract concept of search flights” is not two different APIs.\n\nIn fact we see two concrete implementations.\n\nThis is the learning process itself to confront a Modell with as many implementations as possible - I think it is called learning, while the MCP example simply abstracts implementation away.\n\nSo the guy lacks basic engineering capabilities. It is pretty normal for an engineering to write mediators etc.\n\nI need a model that helps me with the grunt work not the easy going.\n\nA model that can “reasoning about the abstract concept of a flight” is worthless if it goes out of order due to a few API changes.\n\nIn fact this is daily business.\n\nOr to put it shortly: the guy proposes a dumb agent who can compose the simple MCP API while not seeing the opportunity for an agent to come up with an abstraction to build a wrapper API for other APIs.\n\nThis is not good. The guy needs to be clear in his intentions.\n\nWhy have a red background for the - by him - as favorable perceived MCP model and color it red? It looks like a warning not a recommendation at all.
