The specific manufacturer part numbers make it difficult to identify them properly. May I ask what data sources I should use? Should I use publicly available PDF datasheets, or is it better to refer directly to the primary sources—electronic component manufacturers' websites?",

Format your dataset into a question and answer pair.  Figure out the different kind of questions someone might ask.  Plan on your model sorting out the ambiguity in the question being asked by having it ask additional clarifying questions.  You can use a \"Task\" oriented approach where the answer isn't shown until all the elements in your \"frame\" have been filled with data.  Good Luck",
