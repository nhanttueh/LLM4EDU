That may mean taking a CS class, learning basic math notation, or understanding engineering principles—not to code, but to communicate precisely. For some coding is easier that the mastery of communication through language.\n\nPrecision beats verbosity. You still must study and learn domain knowledge. \n\nExample of an expert in ML prompting a LLM:\n\"In a discounted infinite-horizon MDP with continuous state and action spaces, I’m seeing policy oscillation under standard Bellman optimality updates.\nHow would you stabilize convergence by modifying the Bellman backup—e.g., through soft Bellman operators, entropy regularization, or conservative Q-updates—without sacrificing asymptotic optimality?\"\n\nExample of  a non-expert prompting : \n“I want to find the reward for a few business decisions at work.”\n\nWhat do you think the results will be for each end user of the LLM? Which kind user do you think finds the best solution the fastest?  Still feel like an engineering degree is a waste of time? Think again.",
