Does he mean traditional machine learning models plateaued at unacceptably low rates of accuracy, while DNNs can reach 100% (i.e., perfection) with enough data? Also, doesn't this graph gloss over the possibility of overfitting for larger DNNs? I am assuming the y axis represents accuracy on test sets.",

I think a security nightmare is incoming if this is how other employers think. Truly creative or important work will never be produced by \"making more faster\", we should tread very carefully here.
