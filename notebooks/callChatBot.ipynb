Lack of access to supplementary materials – Most frequent barrier: Repeated confusion/frustration over the \"online videos\" or recaps referenced in lectures (DeepLearning.AI/Coursera modules).

      "3. Unclear practical trade-offs – Difficulty deciding between techniques (fine-tuning vs prompting vs RAG), understanding MCP risks (security, tokens, costs), and evaluating agents — viewers want clearer, slower guidelines. \n",

      "\n",
      "Positive Factors (Dominant, ~90–95% of feedback): \n",
      "- Andrew Ng's exceptional teaching clarity – Consistently called \"GOAT/legend\", praised for making complex topics simple, accessible, and exciting (\"never feel dumb\", \"finally understand the basics\", \"unmatched clarity\"). \n",
      "- Practical, real-world focus – Heavy emphasis on applicable techniques (agents, RAG, prompting, project strategy) with concrete examples/case studies — viewers love the \"industrial/practical\" angle over pure theory. \n",
      "- Free global access to Stanford-level education – Repeated gratitude for YouTube availability (\"gem on YouTube\", \"priceless gift\", \"what a time to be alive\"). \n",
      "- Inspiration and motivation – Beginners especially feel included and motivated; many credit Ng for starting/inspiring their AI careers. \n",
      "- Modern, relevant content – Topics like agentic workflows, RAG, RLHF seen as cutting-edge and valuable. \n",

      "Question 60: Synthesizing the comments, what is the most important aspect of the lecture that needs improvement?\n",
      "Answer A [Based strictly on the comments across all lectures, the single most important aspect needing improvement is the audio quality and general production quality.\n",
      "This is the most frequent and most consistent complaint.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔧 1. Audio Quality (Top Issue Across Videos)\n",
      "Viewers repeatedly mention:\n",
      "“I can’t hear the student questions.”\n",
      "“The voice is too low.”\n",
      "“Audio needs to be improved.”\n",
      "“There is echo.”\n",
      "“Sound is muffled.”\n",
      "This issue appears in multiple lectures, from Lecture 1 through Lecture 10.\n",
      "This is the clearest, most universally identified weakness.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Missing Slides / Referenced Videos\n",
      "Another recurring issue:\n",
      "Learners struggle because referenced materials aren’t linked or available.\n",
      "Many ask: “Where are the online videos?”\n",
      "Or: “Where are the slides?”\n",
      "But this appears less frequently than audio complaints.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Lecture Numbering / Playlist Confusion\n",
      "Some viewers express confusion about:\n",
      "missing Lecture 7\n",
      "numbering mismatches\n",
      "difficulty finding the right video\n",
      "This is notable but still secondary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Synthesis\n",
      "The most important improvement needed — by far — is better audio quality (clearer voice, consistent volume, audible student questions).\n",
      "It is the dominant negative theme across comments and the only issue mentioned repeatedly in almost every lecture.\n",
      "Everything else (missing slides, numbering confusion, fast pacing) appears far less often and with lower intensity.];\n",
      "Answer B [The most important aspect needing improvement, based on synthesizing the comments, is audio quality. \n",
      "\n",
      "- This is the most frequent complaint across multiple lectures: viewers repeatedly describe the sound as muffled, echoey, low volume, or hard to hear (especially problematic for non-native speakers). \n",
      "- Examples: \"audio quality😅\", \"needs better audio\", \"sound needs to improve\", \"his voice is too low\", \"echo\", \"audio clipped\". \n",
      "- It detracts from an otherwise highly praised experience and is mentioned far more often than any other issue. \n",
      "\n",
      "Secondary concerns (less frequent): \n",
      "- Lack of public access to referenced preparatory videos/slides. \n",
      "- Occasional calls for digital slides over whiteboard. \n",
      "\n",
      "Audio stands out clearly as the top priority for improvement.];\n",

    "I'm doing scientific research, I'll describe the research, please help me be a judge to grade it. Description:\n",
    "Objective. This project aims to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in responding to real-world queries based on YouTube comments, particularly in the context of online educational videos.\n",
    "Context. Viewer comments on YouTube not only express emotions but also reflect learners’ understanding, interests, and learning experiences. Querying and synthesizing information from these comments can help educators and content managers better capture learner feedback and improve instructional quality.\n",
    "Data. The queries were constructed based on user comments from 9 videos in the Stanford CS230: Deep Learning (Autumn 2025), \n",
    "Methodology. The study uses a set of 80 queries representing diverse tasks such as: Information extraction, Sentiment analysis, Topic identification, Inference, Summarization and judgment, etc.\n",
    "The three LLMs being compared are:\n",
    "ChatGPT 5.1, Like K2, and Grok 4.1 (however, to ensure fairness, I will hide the names of the responding models and replace them with random A, B, C)\n",
    "Each model's responses are evaluated according to three key criteria:\n",
    "Accuracy - Correctness of information and avoidance of unsupported hallucinations\n",
    "Relevance - Alignment with the query's intent and requirements\n",
    "Coverage - Breadth and completeness in addressing key aspects mentioned or implied\n",
    "✍️ How to Evaluate\n",
    "Each response will be evaluated using two methods:\n",
    "Pairwise Comparison: Choose the better response between two models\n",
    "Pointwise scoring: Rate each model independently on a scale from 1 to 10\n",
    "Now I will provide comments on each of the 9 videos. You can start when you have commented on all 9 and I signal you to rate them.\n",
    "—--------\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's begin the scoring. Based on the detailed data from the 9 videos I've provided, please act as the judge and score the following 12 questions:\n",
    "Part 1: Pair Matching - Choose the better response between two models\n",
    "Question {number}: {question_text}\n",
    "Answer A [{answer_a}];\n",
    "Answer B [{answer_b}];\n",
    "Answer C:[{answer_c}].\n",
    "Accuracy\n",
    "Accuracy assesses the extent to which answers accurately reflect the information contained in the comments, avoiding false information, unfounded speculation, and fabricated content not supported by comment data.\n",
    "1. Based on the two answers to question {number}, if considering accuracy alone, which answer, A or B, more accurately reflects the information in the comments, with fewer errors or unfounded speculations?\n",
    "☐ A \n",
    "☐ B \n",
    "☐ A and B are tied\n",
    "2. Based on the two answers to question {number}, if considering accuracy alone, which answer, A or C, more accurately reflects the information in the comments, with fewer errors or unfounded speculations?\n",
    "☐ A \n",
    "☐ C \n",
    "☐ A and C are tied\n",
    "3. Based on the two answers to question {number}, considering accuracy alone, which answer, B or C, more accurately reflects the information in the comments, with fewer errors or unfounded speculations?\n",
    "☐ B \n",
    "☐ C\n",
    "☐ B and C are tied\n",
    "Relevance\n",
    "Relevance assesses the degree to which an answer closely addresses the query's requirements. An answer is considered highly relevant if it directly addresses the core question, is concise, doesn't stray from the topic, and doesn't omit any key elements of the query.\n",
    "Based on the two answers to question {number}, considering only their relevance, which answer more accurately addresses the core of the query, avoiding digressions or omissions of the main point?\n",
    "4. Based on the two answers to question {number}, considering only their relevance, which answer, A or B, addresses the core of the query more accurately, avoiding digressions or omissions of the main point?\n",
    "☐ A \n",
    "☐ B \n",
    "☐ A and B are tied\n",
    "5. Based on the two answers to question {number}, considering only their relevance, which answer, A or C, addresses the core of the query more accurately, avoiding digressions or omissions of the main point?\n",
    "☐ A \n",
    "☐ C\n",
    "☐ A and C are tied\n",
    "6. Based on the two answers to question {number}, considering only their relevance, which answer, B or C, addresses the core of the query more accurately, avoiding digressions or omissions of the main point?\n",
    "☐ B \n",
    "☐ C\n",
    "☐ B and C are tied\n",
    "3. Coverage\n",
    "Coverage assesses the extent to which an answer fully addresses the important aspects requested in the query. A highly comprehensive answer will synthesize multiple dimensions of information contained in the comments, without omitting any key points or necessary aspects.\n",
    "Based on the two answers to question {number}, considering only their relevance, which answer more accurately addresses the core of the query, avoiding digressions or omissions of the main point?\n",
    "7. Based on the two answers to question {number}, considering only the coverage, which answer, A or B, provides a more complete picture of the key aspects of the query?\n",
    "☐ A \n",
    "☐ B \n",
    "☐ A and B are tied\n",
    "8. Based on the two answers to question {number}, considering only the coverage, which answer, A or C, provides a more complete picture of the key aspects of the query?\n",
    "☐ A \n",
    "☐ C\n",
    "☐ A and C are tied\n",
    "9. Based on the two answers to question {number}, considering only the coverage, which answer, B or C, provides a more complete picture of the key aspects of the query?\n",
    "☐ B \n",
    "☐ C\n",
    "☐ B and C are tied\n",
    "Part 2: Scoring on a 10-point scale\n",
    "Accuracy\n",
    "10. To what extent do the answers accurately reflect the information contained in the comments, and do they avoid misinformation or unfounded speculation?\n",
    "Score, Description of criteria\n",

    "3 – 4\n",
    "Weak:While some information is correct, it is mixed with a lot of misinformation or unfounded speculation. Users cannot trust this answer without verifying it.\n",
    "5 – 6\n",
    "Medium:The basic information is correct, but there are some minor errors in figures, proper names, or supplementary details. There are no serious errors in terms of logic/background knowledge.\n",
    "7 – 8\n",
    "Good:The information is accurate and reliable. There are no factual errors. Any inferences (if any) are logically based on the data.\n",
    "9 – 10\n",
    "Excellent:Absolutely 100% accurate. Every statement is true. There is no ambiguity whatsoever regarding its correctness.\n",
    "Please assign points in order: How many points for A, how many points for B, and how many points for C?\n",
    "Relevance\n",

    "Score, Description of criteria\n",
    "1 – 2\n",
    "Digress:The answer is irrelevant to the question or addresses a different question altogether. Completely useless.\n",
    "3 – 4\n",
    "Weak:The topic is mentioned but the response is roundabout, contains too much unnecessary information (filler words), or repeats the question verbatim without addressing the issue.\n",
    "5 – 6\n",
    "Medium:The answers are reasonably focused, but there are still rambling passages or disorganized sentence structures that make it difficult for the reader to grasp the main points.\n",
    "7 – 8\n",
    "Good:It directly answers the question. The structure is clear and easy to understand. It eliminates most of the distracting information.\n",
    "9 – 10\n",
    "Excellent:The answer is concise, brief, yet valuable. It gets straight to the point from the first sentence. The formatting (bullet point, bold/light) is optimized for readability.\n",
    "Please assign points in order: How many points for A, how many points for B, and how many points for C?\n",
    "Relevance\n",
    "12. To what extent does the answer address all the important aspects raised in the query? Are there any significant points omitted?\n",
    "Score, Description of criteria\n",
    "1 – 2\n",
    "Very flawed:Ignoring most of the main requirements of the question. Only answering a very small or insignificant part of it.\n",
    "3 – 4\n",
    "Lack:Omitting at least one important/core aspect of the question. For example: Asking about advantages and disadvantages but only mentioning the advantages.\n",
    "5 – 6\n",
    "Medium:The main points are mentioned, but the discussion lacks depth and is superficial. It is missing necessary supporting details or illustrative examples.\n",
    "7 – 8\n",
    "Good:The response addresses all aspects of the query, leaving no key points unanswered. The depth of the response is good.\n",
    "9 – 10\n",
    "Excellent:Comprehensive and thorough. It not only answers all the questions but also provides context, insightful perspectives, or exceptions (if needed). Exceeds expectations in terms of detail.\n",
