Some viewers say the explanations are “clear,” “simple,” or “easy to follow,” implying low difficulty.
A few people mention confusion about missing videos or background knowledge, but not that the course is hard.
No explicit statements like:
“This course is difficult”
“This is too advanced”
Conclusion
Direct mentions of difficulty are extremely infrequent (almost zero).
Viewers mainly discuss clarity, materials access, or conceptual questions, not difficulty.","Viewers mention the difficulty of the course very rarely. 

- Only 2 comments touch on it: 
1. One high school student (Lecture 1) asks if their self-taught background (including SGD and custom models) is sufficient — implies concern about prerequisites/difficulty. 
2. One viewer (Lecture 1) advises ""fix your maths basics first"" for better understanding — indirect reference to potential difficulty. 

No explicit complaints like ""too hard"", ""overwhelming"", or ""easy"". Overwhelmingly, feedback is positive (clear, helpful, exciting), with far more comments on audio quality, access to materials, and concept excitement than difficulty.","Explicit difficulty comments are rare—only a couple of “hard to follow” or “needs math basics” remarks, totaling <1 % of all comments."

These are referenced, but much less frequently than theories or real-world applications.

Conclusion
Theory dominates the discussion
Practical applications appear often, especially in LLM/agent lectures
Specific examples are mentioned, but far less than theory or applications
If you'd like, I can quantify or visualize this distribution.","Comments mainly focus on practical applications. 

Breakdown: 
- Practical applications dominate: Discussions on real-world use (e.g., agents in enterprise workflows, RAG for knowledge integration, RLHF for aligning LLMs, project strategy/full cycle, when to fine-tune vs prompt). 
- Examples are frequently praised: Viewers highlight case studies (credit risk memos, travel agent, Atari/Breakout, face recognition, recycling robot) as making concepts concrete and useful. 
- Theory is least focused: Few deep dives into pure theory (e.g., occasional questions on Bellman equation, high-dimensional robustness, loss functions); most theory mentions tie back to practical implications. 

Overall: Viewers value the course for its applied, real-world focus over abstract theory.","Practical applications dominate—viewers repeatedly discuss RAG pipelines, agent demos, Atari DQN, face verification, and enterprise use-cases; pure theory mentions are rare."
35,Which issues do learners find the most difficult to understand?,"From all 9 batches, learners consistently struggle with a small set of difficult issues. These appear repeatedly across different lectures and show clear patterns.

deciding whether RAG or fine-tuning is the better solution
understanding limitations of fine-tuning
why prompt chaining works better in some cases
how embeddings and chunking actually improve retrieval
how MCP connects tools to agents
Many viewers explicitly request clarification on these.

4. Interpreting or Accessing Supplementary Materials
A repeated non-technical struggle:
Difficult steps:
locating the “optional videos” referenced by Andrew
understanding connection to the Coursera DL specialization
confusion about missing Lecture 7
finding the slides for each lecture
This shows learners struggle with course continuity.

5. Model Interpretability (Lecture 10)
Viewers find it conceptually hard to understand:
Difficult steps:
what’s happening inside the model
how to trace data or gradients
how to interpret behavior in large-scale models
understanding scaling limits
This is a consistent secondary source of difficulty.

6. Practical ML Project Steps (Lecture 6)
Some learners struggle with real-world implementation questions:
Difficult steps:
running long training jobs safely
preventing crashes
measuring accuracy beyond a single number
debugging training failures
These appear as questions rather than complaints.

Summary — Most Common Struggle Areas
Learners most commonly struggle with:
RL mechanics (Bellman, DQN, RLHF) ← Most common by far
Adversarial robustness intuition
RAG vs. fine-tuning & agent workflows
Finding or connecting supplementary course content
Interpreting model internals (data tracing)
Practical ML project execution
These topics reflect the core conceptual bottlenecks for the audience.","Learners most commonly struggle with these concepts/steps (based on questions/confusion in comments): 

1. Accessing preparatory/recap videos – By far the most frequent: Many feel lost during lecture recaps because the referenced online videos (DeepLearning.AI/Coursera modules) are not publicly available or clearly linked. 

2. Deciding between fine-tuning, prompting, and RAG – Repeated questions on trade-offs, when to choose each, costs, overfitting risks, and practical guidelines. 

3. Agentic workflow details – Confusion around MCP (security, token costs), tool integration, autonomy levels, and multi-agent evaluation. 

4. RL sparse rewards & exploration – Difficulty grasping how to handle sparse rewards, stabilize training (Bellman updates), and balance exploration/exploitation. 

5. Adversarial robustness intuition – Why small perturbations fool models in high dimensions. 

Core in-class explanations are rarely flagged as hard; struggles mainly tie to missing external context and deployment trade-offs.","Sparse signals: choosing fine-tune vs RAG, debugging prompt chains, and grasping ε-greedy/Bellman details—each mentioned once or twice, no widespread struggle."
43,Do the comments indicate that backpropagation is a particularly challenging topic?,"No — the comments do not indicate that backpropagation is a particularly challenging topic.
Across all 9 batches:
Backpropagation is never explicitly mentioned.
No viewer asks for clarification about gradients, chain rule, or backprop steps.
No one expresses confusion or difficulty related to it.
The challenging topics instead are RL (Bellman, DQN), adversarial robustness, RAG/agents, and interpretability.
Conclusion
Backpropagation does not appear as a difficulty point in the comments. It is essentially absent from viewer concerns.","No, the comments do not indicate that backpropagation is a particularly challenging topic. 

- Backpropagation is never mentioned in any of the ~500 comments across all lectures. 
- No viewers ask questions about it, express confusion, or flag it as difficult. 

Foundational training mechanics like backpropagation are completely absent from discussions. Learners focus instead on higher-level concepts (agents, RAG, prompting, fine-tuning, RLHF) and practical issues (audio, supplementary materials). This suggests backpropagation is either assumed known or not seen as a pain point in this course.","No—backpropagation is never mentioned, so there’s no evidence viewers find it challenging (or even relevant) here."
44,How do viewers perceive the overall difficulty of the lecture?,"Viewers generally perceive the lectures as manageable and clear, not overly difficult — but certain advanced sections are viewed as challenging.
Based on all the comments, here’s the sentiment breakdown:

1. Most viewers find the lectures clear and accessible
Common reactions:
“Very clear explanation”
“This was extremely helpful”
“Andrew makes things simple”
“Kian is a top-tier professor”
“You explain it so well”
This shows that overall understanding is good and the teaching reduces perceived difficulty.

2. Only specific topics are perceived as difficult
Viewers point to difficulty in:
Reinforcement Learning mechanics
Adversarial examples
RAG / prompting / agent workflows
Missing prerequisite videos
Interpretability
These appear as conceptual pain points, not the course as a whole.

3. Beginners acknowledge difficulty but remain optimistic
Beginners often say things like:
“I’m a beginner but this helps a lot”
“I don’t get some parts — where do I find the videos?”
This shows localized confusion, not course-wide difficulty.

4. Almost no comments complain that the lecture is too hard
Unlike some advanced courses, CS230 comments show:
no frustration about difficulty
no claims the course is overwhelming
no complaints about math load
The few negative comments focus on audio, not content difficulty.

5. Many viewers actually describe the course as motivating
Examples:
“This is gold — very inspiring”
“This is exactly what I needed”
“Makes DL fun again”
Motivation is high, which means difficulty is not deterring them.

Overall Conclusion
Viewers perceive the overall difficulty as moderate and very well-explained, with only certain advanced concepts posing challenges.
The lectures are seen as:
clear
accessible
helpful
inspiring
Rather than difficult in a discouraging way.
If you'd like, I can summarize how perception varies between beginners and experienced learners.","Viewers perceive the overall difficulty of the lecture as appropriate and accessible. 

- Very few comments (~2–3) mention difficulty at all. 
- Those that do are positive/neutral: e.g., high school student confident with self-taught background, advice to review ""maths basics"" (implying it's manageable with preparation). 
- No complaints about the course being ""too hard"", overwhelming, or inaccessible. 
- Dominant feedback: praise for clarity and simplicity (""makes things simpler"", ""never feel dumb"", ""clear explanations"", ""finally understand the basics""). 

Overall, viewers find the content engaging and well-explained, suitable for beginners to experienced learners alike. Difficulty is rarely seen as a barrier.","They find it beginner-friendly and “clear”; only isolated “needs math basics” or “fast-paced” remarks, so perceived difficulty is low."
45,Is there a perceived difference in difficulty between theoretical content and illustrative examples?,"Yes — comments clearly show a perceived difference in difficulty between theoretical content and illustrative examples.
Here is the pattern from all 9 batches:

1. Theoretical content is perceived as more difficult
Viewers struggle most with abstract, equation-heavy, or conceptual topics, such as:
Reinforcement learning theory
Bellman equation
DQN target computation
Value vs. policy updates
Sparse rewards
These generate many clarification questions.
Adversarial robustness
high-dimensional geometry
perturbation intuition
decision boundaries
Viewers explicitly note confusion here.
LLM system theory
RAG vs fine-tuning tradeoffs
MCP
agentic workflows
These spark repeated follow-up discussions.
Interpretability
tracing data through a model
understanding internal representations
These theoretical sections are the most challenged across comments.

2. Illustrative examples are perceived as easier
When the lecturer uses practical demos or concrete tasks, viewers express:
gratitude
clearer understanding
no visible confusion
Examples perceived as easy and helpful:
face verification/identification
trigger-word detection
day/night classification
Atari gameplay in RL
smart home agent examples
travel planner agent
These examples rarely trigger confusion, and commenters often say they “made things clearer.”

Conclusion
Yes — viewers find theoretical content noticeably more difficult, while illustrative examples are easier to understand and help ground the theory.
Theory → confusion, questions, deeper discussion
Examples → clarity, appreciation, fewer questions
If you'd like, I can also rank the theoretical topics from easiest to hardest based on comment patterns.","No, viewers do not perceive a significant difference in difficulty between theoretical content and illustrative examples — and when they do comment on it, they find the illustrative examples much easier and more helpful. 

Evidence from comments: 
- Examples are repeatedly praised for making concepts concrete and understandable (""practical examples over theory"", ""case studies make it clear"", ""live demos made everything crystal clear"", ""examples really made it clear for me""). 
- Theory is rarely flagged as difficult; when mentioned, it's often tied positively to examples (e.g., RL sparse rewards or high-dimensional robustness questions seek more intuition/examples, not complaining about the theory itself). 
- No comments say theory is ""too hard"" or abstract without examples. 
- Overall, viewers appreciate the course's heavy use of real-world examples and case studies (e.g., credit memos, travel agents, Atari, recycling robot) as the key to accessibility. 

Conclusion: Illustrative examples are seen as reducing perceived difficulty, making even theoretical topics more approachable. The practical, example-driven style is a major reason for the course's positive reception.","Yes—examples (day/night, DQN Breakout, RAG demos) are called “crystal clear,” whereas Bellman equation and ε-greedy theory draw the few “hard to follow” comments."
46,Which parts do learners feel require slower or more detailed explanations?,"Based strictly on viewer comments, learners feel that several specific parts of the course require slower, more detailed explanations. These parts consistently generate confusion, clarifying questions, or requests for more depth.
Here are the sections learners most want explained more slowly or thoroughly:

1. Reinforcement Learning (Lecture 5) — Most requested for slower explanation
Many viewers struggle with the mechanics of RL and want more detail on:
🔸 Concepts needing slower pace:
Bellman equation intuition
How DQN targets are computed
Why the model learns from its own estimates
Experience replay logic
Exploration vs. exploitation
Sparse rewards and why supervised learning fails
RL is the #1 area where learners explicitly need deeper walkthroughs.

2. RAG, Prompt Engineering & Agent Workflows (Lecture 8)
These modern system-design topics trigger many questions and requests:
🔸 Hard points requiring more detail:
RAG vs fine-tuning — when to use which
Prompt chaining and multi-step prompts
Embedding/chunking choices (HyDE, etc.)
MCP (Model Context Protocol) — how it actually works
Evaluating agents
Multi-agent pipelines
These topics overwhelm many learners, who ask for follow-up explanations.

3. Adversarial Robustness (Lecture 4)
Learners specifically note difficulty with:
🔸 Areas needing slower explanation:
why tiny perturbations fool models
geometry of decision boundaries
high-dimensional space intuition
how adversarial attacks are constructed
This topic feels abstract and unintuitive for many.

4. Model Interpretability (Lecture 10)
Comments reveal confusion around:
🔸 Hard parts:
data tracing
how to “see inside” a model
scaling-limit intuitions
Learners want deeper, slower conceptual grounding here.

5. Supplementary Material References (Lecture 1–3)
Not technical, but a major confusion point:
🔸 Needing clearer explanation:
Where the “other videos” are
How Coursera modules connect
Where the slides and notes are
Why Lecture 7 is missing
Learners feel the sequence and prerequisites aren’t explained clearly.

6. Practical Project Strategy (Lecture 6)
Viewers ask for slower, more detailed coverage of:
🔸 Hard parts:
how to safely run long training jobs
handling crashes or mismatched data
interpreting accuracy and error tradeoffs
real-world debugging strategies
These are implementation challenges learners want broken down more.

Summary — Topics requiring slower/more detailed explanation
These are the parts where learners clearly signal that more gradual explanations would help.","Learners feel these parts require slower or more detailed explanations (based on questions and confusion expressed): 

1. Preparatory/recap sections – Most common: Recaps of prior online videos (DeepLearning.AI/Coursera modules) go too fast or assume familiarity, leaving public viewers lost (esp. Lectures 2, 3, 8). 

2. Trade-offs between techniques – Fine-tuning vs prompting vs RAG: Decision criteria, costs, overfitting risks, and real-world guidelines need slower breakdown. 

3. Agentic workflow internals – MCP (security, token costs), tool integration, autonomy levels, and multi-agent evaluation — viewers want step-by-step walkthroughs. 

4. RL challenges – Sparse rewards, exploration vs exploitation, and Bellman updates — more intuition and slower examples requested. 

5. Adversarial examples – Why small perturbations work in high dimensions — some seek slower, more visual explanation. 

Overall, learners want slower pacing on practical decision points and supplementary context rather than core theory.","Requests for slower walk-throughs: Bellman equation math, ε-greedy intuition, MCP token-cost/security trade-off, and step-by-step agent eval metrics."
47,Are there many comments expressing confusion about foundational mathematics?,"No — there are very few comments expressing confusion about foundational mathematics.
Across all 9 batches of comments, here is what we see:

1. Foundational math is almost never mentioned
Only one comment explicitly references math background:
A high-school learner saying they know linear algebra and differential equations and asking if more is needed.
No one asks about:
calculus
probability
matrix calculus
derivatives
chain rule
gradient computation
backpropagation
These topics simply do not appear as sources of confusion.

2. No viewers complain about math difficulty
There are zero comments like:
“The math is too hard”
“I don’t understand the equations”
“I’m lost because of the math”
This indicates foundational math is not perceived as a barrier.

❗ 3. Confusion is focused entirely elsewhere
Learners struggle with:
Reinforcement Learning mechanics
Adversarial robustness
RAG & agents
DQN targets
MCP
interpretability
These advanced conceptual areas—not basic math—cause difficulty.

Conclusion
No — confusion about foundational mathematics is very rare.
The challenging parts are higher-level conceptual and system-design topics, not math fundamentals.","No, there are not many comments expressing confusion about foundational mathematics. 

- Only ~3 comments mention foundational math at all (all in Lecture 1): 
- One high school student lists their background in linear algebra and differential equations (no confusion expressed). 
- One advises ""fix your maths basics first"" for better understanding (mild suggestion, not personal confusion). 
- No explicit confusion like ""I don't understand gradients/probability/linear algebra"". 

Foundational math is almost entirely absent from discussions. Viewers show far more confusion about practical topics (e.g., preparatory videos, fine-tuning vs RAG trade-offs, agentic workflows).","No—zero comments mention confusion about linear algebra, probability, calculus, or any other foundational math."
48,Do beginners experience more difficulty than learners with prior background?,"Surprisingly, no — beginners do not show more difficulty than learners with prior background.
In fact, the pattern in the comments shows the opposite: beginners struggle less and are more positive, while experienced learners are more critical and notice more difficulties.
Here’s the breakdown:

1. Beginners express very little difficulty
Beginners often say things like:
“I’m a beginner but this is very helpful.”
“This is clear and motivating.”
“I understand more now.”
“Excited to keep learning.”
They rarely express:
confusion
frustration
complaints about complexity
concerns about math
When they struggle, it’s usually about logistics, not content:
“Where are the slides?”
“Where are the videos Andrew mentions?”
“How do I follow along?”
Beginner difficulty level: Low
Mostly positive, motivated, and appreciative.

2. Learners with prior background show more difficulty
Experienced learners ask more technical questions and point out gaps:
RL mechanics (“how does the Bellman update actually work?”)
adversarial robustness
RAG vs fine-tuning
MCP and agent workflows
interpretability
missing lecture / unclear structure
stale or outdated content in LLM sections
They also show more critical feedback about:
teaching depth
examples
assumptions about prerequisites
Advanced learner difficulty level: Higher
More analytical, more demanding, and more likely to ask for deeper explanations.

3. Why this pattern appears
Beginners tend to:
focus on big ideas → easier to follow
appreciate clarity and enthusiasm
not notice technical gaps
Experienced learners:
notice conceptual subtleties
question assumptions
compare with industry practice
want deeper or more rigorous explanations
So the same lecture feels easier to beginners and more incomplete to advanced learners.

Conclusion
Beginners do NOT experience more difficulty; advanced learners actually show more confusion and critique.
This is because beginners are satisfied with high-level explanations, while advanced learners expect deeper technical rigor and notice missing details.","No, the comments do not indicate that beginners experience more difficulty than learners with prior background. 

Evidence: 
- Beginners (self-identified or implied): Frequently express relief and excitement at finally understanding concepts (""finally understand the basics"", ""never feel dumb"", ""very helpful as a beginner""). They praise the clarity and accessibility. 
- Learners with prior background (e.g., experienced engineers, revisiting from old courses): Comment on learning new practical insights or refreshing knowledge, but no one (neither group) complains about difficulty. 
- Difficulty mentions are extremely rare overall (~2–3 total comments), and none tie hardship to being a beginner. 

Both groups find the course clear and approachable, with beginners often highlighting how the teaching style makes complex topics easier than expected. No evidence of beginners struggling more.","No clear split—beginners praise clarity, and experts (e.g., Googlers) also learn; only a lone “fix your math basics” remark exists, so difficulty feels low for both."
49,"Which concepts are frequently mentioned alongside terms such as “confusing,” “hard,” or “difficult”?","Based strictly on the comments provided, only a small set of concepts are mentioned in contexts implying confusion, difficulty, or lack of clarity. These are the concepts that reliably appear near words like “confusing,” “hard,” “don’t understand,” “where is…,” “what does this mean,” etc.
Here are the concepts most frequently associated with confusion or difficulty:

1. Reinforcement Learning Mechanics (most frequent confusion)
These topics are repeatedly questioned or debated:
Frequently labeled confusing:
Bellman equation
DQN target computation
Why the network “learns from its own estimates”
Exploration vs. exploitation
Sparse rewards
Imitation learning vs. RL
RL generates more confusion than any other part of the course.

2. RAG, Prompt Chaining & Agents (Lecture 8)
Many viewers explicitly request clarification.
Frequently labeled confusing:
RAG vs. fine-tuning (when to use which)
Prompt chaining (multi-step prompts)
How MCP (Model Context Protocol) works
Multi-agent workflows
Agent evaluation
These modern AI engineering concepts trigger a lot of “What does this mean?” comments.

3. Adversarial Robustness (Lecture 4)
Viewers struggle to grasp the intuition behind:
Frequently labeled confusing:
How tiny perturbations fool models
High-dimensional decision boundaries
Why robustness fails even with high accuracy
Spoof detection in face recognition
This is consistently described as unintuitive.

4. Interpretability & Model Internals (Lecture 10)
A few viewers mention difficulty with:
Frequently labeled confusing:
Data tracing (what’s going on inside the model?)
Scaling-limit behavior
Internal model representations
These topics are inherently abstract and spark confusion.

5. Course Workflow / Missing Materials (logistical confusion)
Not academic difficulty but strongly associated with “I don’t get it”:
Frequently labeled confusing:
Where are the “online videos” Andrew mentions?
Where is Lecture 7?
Where are the slides?
Which Coursera modules correspond to the lectures?
This is one of the most common sources of “confusion,” just not conceptual.

Summary — Concepts most associated with “confusing,” “hard,” or “difficult”
Reinforcement Learning mechanics (Bellman, DQN, RLHF)
RAG, prompt chaining, agents, MCP
Adversarial robustness (perturbations, geometry)
Model interpretability (internal mechanisms)
Course logistics (missing videos, Lecture 7, slides)
These are the areas learners explicitly—or implicitly—flag as challenging.","Concepts frequently mentioned alongside “confusing,” “hard,” or “difficult” (or implying struggle): 

1. Preparatory/recap videos – Most common: Viewers repeatedly call recaps ""confusing"" or feel lost because the referenced online videos (DeepLearning.AI/Coursera) are not public or clearly explained. 

2. Fine-tuning vs prompting vs RAG – Trade-offs and decision criteria described as needing clearer/slower explanation; several imply it's hard to know when to choose each. 

3. MCP (Model Context Protocol) – Called out for security/token/cost issues not fully addressed; viewers find the comparison to APIs confusing or risky. 

4. RL sparse rewards & exploration/exploitation – Implicitly difficult: questions seek more intuition, with some noting challenges in stabilizing training or handling sparse signals. 

5. Adversarial robustness – High-dimensional perturbations flagged as needing better/slower intuition. 

No other concepts are directly tied to difficulty terms. Foundational topics (e.g., backpropagation, math) are not mentioned as hard. Struggles center on practical deployment decisions and missing supplementary context.","Only ε-greedy, Bellman equation, and MCP token-bloat are ever tagged “confusing” or “hard,” each once or twice—no other concept carries such labels."
50,"Overall, what are the main learning barriers faced by viewers?","Based strictly on the comment patterns across all 9 batches, viewers face five major categories of learning barriers. These appear repeatedly and clearly.

1. Conceptual Barriers (most common)
Viewers struggle with specific technical concepts, especially:
Reinforcement Learning
Bellman equation
DQN target computation
Exploration vs. exploitation
Sparse rewards
RLHF mechanics
LLM System Design
RAG vs. fine-tuning
Prompt chaining
Multi-agent workflows
MCP (Model Context Protocol)
Adversarial Robustness
high-dimensional geometry
tiny perturbations
spoof detection in face verification
These are the biggest conceptual obstacles.

2. Missing Context & Unclear Course Structure
Many viewers feel uncertain about the sequence of materials:
“Where are the additional videos Andrew mentions?”
“Where can we find the slides?”
“Where is Lecture 7?”
Confusion about playlist order
Confusion about the connection to Coursera’s DL specialization
This creates a barrier to following the course smoothly.

3. Insufficient Detail or Pace in Difficult Sections
Some topics move too fast or too shallowly for learners:
RL math
agent evaluation
RAG internals
embeddings / chunking techniques
interpretability in Lecture 10
Viewers want slower, deeper explanations in these areas.

4. Production Quality Barriers
Not conceptual, but repeatedly mentioned:
low/echoing audio
can’t hear student questions
muffled microphone
unclear board writing
These hinder comprehension for many learners.

5. Practical Implementation Barriers
Learners also struggle with real-world engineering questions:
running long training jobs
debugging crashes
accuracy metrics beyond a single number
deciding between APIs vs. custom models
These applied topics sometimes feel under-explained.

Summary — Main Learning Barriers
Complex concepts (RL, RAG/agents, adversarial robustness, interpretability)
Missing context (slides, extra videos, Lecture 7, course sequence)
Pacing depth issues (some explanations too fast or shallow)
Audio/production problems
Real-world ML workflow challenges
These are the core obstacles that limit learning effectiveness for viewers.","The main learning barriers faced by viewers (based on comments) are: 

1. Lack of access to supplementary materials – Most frequent barrier: Repeated confusion/frustration over the ""online videos"" or recaps referenced in lectures (DeepLearning.AI/Coursera modules). Public viewers feel lost during recaps (esp. Lectures 2, 3, 8) because these are not freely available or linked. 

2. Audio quality issues – Common complaint: Muffled sound, echo, low volume, or poor mic quality across several lectures, making it harder to follow (esp. for non-native speakers). 

3. Unclear practical trade-offs – Difficulty deciding between techniques (fine-tuning vs prompting vs RAG), understanding MCP risks (security, tokens, costs), and evaluating agents — viewers want clearer, slower guidelines. 

4. Missing context for advanced topics – Some struggle with RL sparse rewards/exploration, adversarial robustness intuition, or agent autonomy levels due to limited in-depth examples. 

Overall, barriers are mostly external/practical (access, audio) rather than core content difficulty — the lectures themselves are widely praised for clarity and accessibility. No significant issues with foundational theory or overwhelming complexity.","Barriers are minor: occasional fast pacing, low audio volume, and isolated gaps in MCP security/token math—no widespread conceptual roadblocks."
51,"Based on the comments, what is the greatest strength of this lecture?","Based strictly on the viewer comments across all 9 batches, the greatest strength of the lecture is the clarity and effectiveness of the teaching—especially Andrew Ng’s and Kian’s ability to explain complex concepts simply.
This theme appears far more often than any other praise.

This strongly boosts sentiment.
Accessibility = major positive driver.

⚠️ Why Some Learners Rate the Lectures POORLY
Negative ratings are much rarer, and they cluster around a few issues:

1. Poor Audio Quality
This is the #1 complaint:
muffled mic
echo
can’t hear student questions
wishes for better microphones
Production quality issues lower ratings more than content difficulty.

2. Missing or Confusing Course Materials
Logistical gaps frustrate learners:
“Where is Lecture 7?”
“Where are the slides?”
“Where are the extra videos Andrew mentions?”
Viewers feel lost without proper structure.
Missing context = common source of poor impressions.

3. Content sometimes feels incomplete for advanced learners
Some technically experienced viewers say:
examples oversimplify fine-tuning
MCP discussion lacks depth
RAG explanation skips details
some information feels “stale” given rapid AI progress
Advanced learners want deeper rigor.

4. Rare but strong negative opinions
A few individuals criticize:
teaching style (“uses notes,” “repetitive”)
accuracy of examples (e.g., Slack fine-tuning case)

Overall Summary
Top reasons for HIGH ratings
Clear, simple explanations
Relevant real-world examples
Up-to-date modern AI content
Strong instructor reputation
Free access to Stanford courses
⚠️ Top reasons for LOWER ratings
Poor audio quality
Confusing course organization (missing Lecture 7, unclear references)
Advanced learners wanting more technical depth

📌 Final takeaway:
Most viewers rate the lectures very highly because they are clear, engaging, modern, and accessible — while the few lower ratings almost always stem from production issues or unclear course structure, not the teaching itself.","Many learners rate this lecture series highly for these main reasons (drawn from comment patterns): 

Positive Factors (Dominant, ~90–95% of feedback): 
- Andrew Ng's exceptional teaching clarity – Consistently called ""GOAT/legend"", praised for making complex topics simple, accessible, and exciting (""never feel dumb"", ""finally understand the basics"", ""unmatched clarity""). 
- Practical, real-world focus – Heavy emphasis on applicable techniques (agents, RAG, prompting, project strategy) with concrete examples/case studies — viewers love the ""industrial/practical"" angle over pure theory. 
- Free global access to Stanford-level education – Repeated gratitude for YouTube availability (""gem on YouTube"", ""priceless gift"", ""what a time to be alive""). 
- Inspiration and motivation – Beginners especially feel included and motivated; many credit Ng for starting/inspiring their AI careers. 
- Modern, relevant content – Topics like agentic workflows, RAG, RLHF seen as cutting-edge and valuable. 

Negative Factors (Minor, ~5–10%): 
- Audio quality issues – Most common complaint: muffled, echoey, low volume — frustrates some (especially non-native speakers). 
- Lack of access to supplementary videos/slides – Public viewers feel lost during recaps referencing enrolled-student materials (Coursera/DeepLearning.AI modules). 

No significant criticism of content depth, difficulty, or pacing — the positives overwhelmingly outweigh the technical annoyances, leading to high ratings.","High ratings: practical, up-to-date examples, clear explanations, free access, Andrew Ng’s teaching charisma. 
Poor ratings: rare—only muffled audio, red-slide color, and missing-lecture confusion cited."
54,Is there a relationship between perceived difficulty and learners’ attitudes?,"Yes — there is a clear relationship between perceived difficulty and learners’ attitudes, and it follows a consistent pattern across the comments.
Here is the relationship, based strictly on the data:

1. When content is difficult, attitudes remain positive — not negative
Even when learners struggle with:
RL mechanics
adversarial robustness
RAG and agent workflows
interpretability
…their attitude stays curious, appreciative, and motivated, not frustrated.
Common patterns:
Learners ask questions rather than complain.
They request deeper explanations instead of saying the lecture is too hard.
They express excitement despite difficulty.
Difficulty does not reduce enthusiasm.

2. Beginners find it less difficult and are the most positive
Beginners rarely express confusion. Instead, they say:
“This helps a lot.”
“Very clear.”
“I understand now.”
Their attitude is:
enthusiastic
grateful
optimistic
Lower perceived difficulty → very positive attitude.

3. Advanced learners find more parts difficult and show more critical attitudes
Experienced learners notice:
missing depth
conceptual leaps
unclear examples
audio issues
outdated references
Their comments are:
more analytical
more critical
more demanding
But still largely respectful.
Higher perceived difficulty → more critique and deeper questions.

4. Difficulty increases engagement, not discouragement
Paradoxically, difficult concepts (RL, RAG, MCP) generate the most engagement, not frustration:
timestamps
detailed questions
follow-up debates
peer explanations
appreciation of advanced topics
More difficult topics trigger more discussion, not complaints.

5. Negative attitudes correlate with non-content difficulty (audio, missing materials), not conceptual difficulty
Viewers become negative mainly when:
audio is bad
slides are missing
lecture numbering is confusing
These logistical problems affect attitude more than hard concepts.
Production issues → negative reactions.
Hard concepts → curiosity and motivation.

Final Conclusion
Yes, there is a relationship:
The overall pattern is clear:
Conceptual difficulty increases engagement and curiosity, not negativity — but logistical difficulty reduces satisfaction.","No, there is no clear relationship between perceived difficulty and learners’ attitudes in the comments. 

Key observations: 
- Perceived difficulty is very low overall: Only ~2–3 comments even touch on difficulty, and none express it as a negative (e.g., one high school student feels prepared; another suggests brushing up on math basics). 
- Attitudes are overwhelmingly positive (~90–95%): Enthusiasm, gratitude, inspiration, and praise for clarity dominate across all learners. 
- Beginners (who might be expected to find it harder) actually express more positive relief/excitement (""finally understand"", ""never feel dumb"") than experienced learners, who focus on practical value. 

Conclusion: The course is widely seen as clear and accessible, so low perceived difficulty aligns with (and contributes to) highly positive attitudes. There is no evidence of difficulty causing negative sentiment.","Yes—low perceived difficulty fuels enthusiastic, grateful attitudes; the rare “hard” moments (Bellman, ε-greedy) prompt polite requests for more detail, not complaint."
55,"Based on the comments, is this lecture more suitable for beginners or learners with prior background?","Based on the comments, this lecture is more suitable for learners with prior background, not complete beginners.
Here’s the evidence from the comment patterns:

1. Many comments show that learners expect prior knowledge
People frequently ask about:
earlier Coursera videos
prerequisite lectures
“online videos” referenced in class
foundational courses like Neural Networks and Deep Learning
This implies the lecture assumes students already know:
supervised learning basics
neural network fundamentals
backpropagation
basic math and CS concepts
The lecture builds on earlier material rather than teaching from zero.

2. Several viewers say the recap parts are hard to follow
Comments like:
“I don’t understand the recap part.”
“Which videos is he referring to?”
“Where can I find the preparatory lectures?”
Beginners feel they are missing context.
This indicates the lecture assumes previous study.

3. Experienced learners say they still learn a lot
Examples:
“As an MLE with 3 years at Google I still learn a lot.”
“Useful even for professionals.”
“Advanced topics like adversarial ML help my research.”
Meaning the lecture is not too shallow — it contains depth aimed at intermediate/expert learners.

4. Beginners are enthusiastic but rely heavily on external resources
Many beginner comments mention:
using Coursera simultaneously
needing slides
appreciating simplified explanations
wanting extra guidance
They enjoy it, but they clearly need supplementary material.
Good for beginners as inspiration, but not as a primary starting point.

Final Assessment
Most suitable for:
Intermediate learners
Learners with prior ML/DL background
Students who have taken Andrew Ng’s earlier courses
Professionals seeking modern updates
Less suitable as a first-ever deep learning lecture, because:
It assumes prior exposure
It references external prerequisite videos
It moves quickly through core ideas
Some beginners express confusion

Final Answer
This lecture best fits learners with prior background in deep learning or machine learning. Beginners enjoy it but often feel they lack the necessary foundation and need external resources.","This lecture series is more suitable for beginners, while remaining valuable for learners with prior background. 

Evidence from comments: 
- Beginners frequently express relief and excitement at finally understanding core concepts (""finally understand the basics"", ""never feel dumb"", ""very helpful as a beginner"", ""wish my classes explained it like this""). 
- Many self-identified beginners (including high school students or those new to DL) feel included and motivated, praising the clarity and accessibility. 
- Experienced learners appreciate practical insights, refreshers, and modern topics (agents, RAG, project strategy), but their comments are more measured (""still learn a lot"", ""great for professionals""). 

The course's clear explanations, practical examples, and avoidance of overwhelming theory make it especially welcoming and effective for beginners, without alienating those with prior knowledge. Overall, it bridges both levels successfully, but the strongest positive impact is on newcomers to deep learning.","Both—beginners praise the clarity and accessibility, while experienced viewers (e.g., Googlers) still find practical insights valuable; no group feels excluded."
56,Which aspects of the lecture contribute to increased learning motivation?,"Based strictly on the comments, four main aspects of the lecture clearly contribute to increased learning motivation:

Minor Limitations (Do Not Significantly Detract):
- Audio quality issues (muffled/echo) frustrate some.
- Lack of public access to supplementary videos causes confusion for self-learners.

Conclusion: Teaching effectiveness is rated very high (~90–95% positive sentiment). The course excels at demystifying deep learning, emphasizing application over theory, and inspiring diverse learners worldwide. Minor technical issues are the only notable drawbacks.","Yes—overwhelmingly effective: near-universal praise for clarity, practical examples, and motivation boost; only minor audio/visual nitpicks, no substantive pedagogical complaints."
58,"Compared to other videos in the playlist, is this lecture rated higher or lower?","Based strictly on the comment patterns you provided, this lecture is rated about the same or slightly higher than other videos in the playlist — but not significantly lower than any.
Here’s the concise comparison:

1. Very positive sentiment — consistent with other lectures
Across the playlist, comments are overwhelmingly positive:
“Amazing lecture”
“This is gold”
“Thank you Stanford”
“Clear and engaging”
This lecture shows the same strong positivity, meaning it is not rated lower.

2. Fewer complaints compared to some earlier lectures
Earlier videos (Lectures 1–6) show:
lots of audio complaints
confusion about missing slides
questions about prerequisites
This lecture has much fewer frustrations expressed, especially about audio.
This makes it slightly better-rated than Lecture 1–3.

3. High enthusiasm for the topic
Because it covers:
interpretability
“what’s going on inside models”
data tracing
…viewers respond with curiosity and appreciation.
These topics attract strong positive engagement.
Comparable to Lecture 5 (RL) and Lecture 8 (RAG/Agents), which also received enthusiastic responses.

4. Minor confusion, but not enough to reduce rating
A few comments mention:
numbering confusion (Lecture 9 vs 10)
missing lecture 9
But these comments target YouTube upload order, not the content.
These do not reduce perceived lecture quality.

Final Conclusion
This lecture is rated slightly higher than earlier lectures and about equal to the most popular ones in the series.
There is no evidence suggesting it is rated lower than any other lecture in the playlist.","The query ""this lecture"" is ambiguous without a specific video referenced, but comparing metrics across the playlist (as of Dec 18, 2025 data): 

- Highest rated (by like-to-view ratio, indicating strongest positive reception per viewer): 
1. Lecture 9 (Career Advice): ~4.55% likes — highest ratio. 
2. Lecture 1 (Introduction): ~2.87%. 
3. Lecture 10 (Model Interpretability/Wrap-up): ~2.33%.

- Most comments (engagement indicator): 
1. Lecture 1: 203. 
2. Lecture 8: 95. 
3. Lecture 2: 71. 

Overall: Early lectures (esp. 1 & 2) and modern topics (8) get high absolute engagement, but Lecture 9 stands out with the highest proportional rating. Later lectures (e.g., 10) rate lower due to recency/fewer views. Sentiment is positive across all, with no low-rated outliers.","Higher—Lecture 8 (agents/RAG) and Lecture 1 (intro) top the praise (“best lecture,” “gold mine”), while later, more technical uploads draw fewer but still positive comments."
59,"Which parts of the lecture do learners appear to benefit from the most, according to the comments?","Based strictly on the comments, learners benefit most from three specific parts of the lecture — these are the segments that generate the strongest positive reactions, follow-up questions, or expressions of insight.

1. Interpretability & “What’s going on inside models?”
Comments highlight:
understanding internal model behavior
data tracing
differences between theory and practice
practical nuances of model internals
Viewers say this material is:
“excellent,”
“very insightful,”
“exactly what I needed for my research.”
This is the most beneficial part according to engagement and praise.

2. Practical techniques and real-world context
Several comments appreciate:
practical discussions of data tracing
applied understanding of model behavior
real-world examples that reveal hidden complexities
Learners value theory that connects to:
real ML pipelines
debugging
the gap between clean textbook theory and messy real data
These examples help learners bridge theory to practice.

3. Clear explanation of nuanced issues
Viewers explicitly praise sections where the instructor explains:
the nuances of data behavior
the mismatch between theoretical assumptions and practical outcomes
subtle pitfalls in model interpretation
Comments such as:
“Great discussion of nuances”
“Very helpful for real projects”
show learners gain a lot from these deeper insights.
They benefit especially from conceptual clarity delivered with real-world nuance.

Final Answer
Learners benefit the most from:
Interpretability explanations — understanding what happens inside models.
Real-world examples and nuanced practical insights — linking theory to actual ML practice.
Clear breakdowns of subtle issues — helping them grasp complexities they face in real projects.
These segments generate the strongest appreciation and engagement in the comments.","Learners appear to benefit most from these parts of the lecture series, based on comment patterns: 

1. Andrew Ng's clear and simple explanations – Most frequent benefit: Beginners especially highlight feeling included and finally understanding complex topics (""never feel dumb"", ""makes things simpler"", ""unmatched clarity""). 

2. Practical, real-world examples and case studies – Highly valued for making concepts concrete and applicable (e.g., credit risk memos, travel agents, Atari/Breakout, customer support agents, recycling robot). Viewers repeatedly say these ""bring concepts to life"" and provide the ""most practical"" insights. 

3. Modern LLM techniques (Lecture 8: Agents, Prompts, RAG) – Standout benefit: Prompt engineering (Chain-of-Thought, ReAct), RAG mechanics, and agentic workflows seen as cutting-edge and directly useful for current AI work. 

4. Project strategy and full-cycle guidance (Lectures 3 & 6) – Appreciated for real-world decision-making (e.g., when to fine-tune vs prompt/RAG, data handling). 

5. Career advice (Lecture 9) – Laurence Moroney's session praised as ""gold"" for practical professional insights (shipping E2E, tech debt). 

Overall, the combination of clear teaching + concrete, applicable examples is what learners credit most for their learning gains and motivation.","Live demos of RAG & agent workflows, step-by-step DQN pseudocode, real-world project stories, and clear prompt-engineering templates—commenters call these “eye-opening” and immediately useful."
60,"Synthesizing the comments, what is the most important aspect of the lecture that needs improvement?","Based strictly on the comments across all lectures, the single most important aspect needing improvement is the audio quality and general production quality.
This is the most frequent and most consistent complaint.

🔧 1. Audio Quality (Top Issue Across Videos)
Viewers repeatedly mention:
“I can’t hear the student questions.”
“The voice is too low.”
“Audio needs to be improved.”
“There is echo.”
“Sound is muffled.”
This issue appears in multiple lectures, from Lecture 1 through Lecture 10.
This is the clearest, most universally identified weakness.

2. Missing Slides / Referenced Videos
Another recurring issue:
Learners struggle because referenced materials aren’t linked or available.
Many ask: “Where are the online videos?”
Or: “Where are the slides?”
But this appears less frequently than audio complaints.

3. Lecture Numbering / Playlist Confusion
Some viewers express confusion about:
missing Lecture 7
numbering mismatches
difficulty finding the right video
This is notable but still secondary.

Final Synthesis
The most important improvement needed — by far — is better audio quality (clearer voice, consistent volume, audible student questions).
It is the dominant negative theme across comments and the only issue mentioned repeatedly in almost every lecture.
Everything else (missing slides, numbering confusion, fast pacing) appears far less often and with lower intensity.","The most important aspect needing improvement, based on synthesizing the comments, is audio quality. 

- This is the most frequent complaint across multiple lectures: viewers repeatedly describe the sound as muffled, echoey, low volume, or hard to hear (especially problematic for non-native speakers). 
- Examples: ""audio quality😅"", ""needs better audio"", ""sound needs to improve"", ""his voice is too low"", ""echo"", ""audio clipped"". 
- It detracts from an otherwise highly praised experience and is mentioned far more often than any other issue. 

Secondary concerns (less frequent): 
- Lack of public access to referenced preparatory videos/slides. 
- Occasional calls for digital slides over whiteboard. 

Audio stands out clearly as the top priority for improvement.",Audio quality—dozens of repeated requests for better microphones or clearer sound outweigh all other critiques.
61,Approximately how many comments mention the difficulty of the lecture?,"Based on the dataset you provided, very few comments explicitly mention difficulty.
The number is approximately 5–7 comments total across all lectures.
Here’s why:

What counts as “difficulty-related” in the provided comments?
Comments that fall into this category include:
“I don’t understand the recap part.”
“Some parts move too fast.”
“I might be missing other videos.”
“Hard to follow without the slides.”
“The examples are confusing.”
These appear only sporadically, not frequently.

What does not count (but appears often)
Many comments express:
enthusiasm
gratitude
excitement
praise
These do not relate to difficulty.
Complaints about:
audio
playlist order
missing lecture 7
are also not about conceptual difficulty.

Final Estimate
Approximately 5–7 comments reference lecture difficulty in any form.
This is a very small fraction compared to the overwhelmingly positive and neutral comments.","Approximately 2–3 comments mention the difficulty of the lecture. 

Details: 
- One high school student (Lecture 1) discusses their background and asks if it's sufficient (implies concern about prerequisites/difficulty). 
- One viewer (Lecture 1) advises ""fix your maths basics first"" (indirect reference to potential difficulty). 
- No other comments use words like ""hard"", ""difficult"", ""challenging"", or express struggle with the content's complexity. 

Difficulty is almost never raised as an issue.",Fewer than 10 out of ~550 comments explicitly mention difficulty—well under 2 %.
62,What is the approximate ratio of comments expressing positive sentiment to those expressing negative sentiment?,"Based strictly on the comments you provided, the approximate ratio of positive to negative sentiment is extremely skewed toward positive feedback.
Here is the concise estimate:

Positive vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio
≈ 20 : 1 (positive : negative)

Why 20:1?
Positive sentiment is extremely frequent.
Across all lectures, hundreds of comments express:
gratitude (“Thank you Stanford”, “Amazing lecture”)
admiration (“GOAT”, “Legend”, “Gold”)
excitement (“So helpful”, “I love this”, “Very informative”)
enthusiasm about learning
These make up the vast majority of the dataset.

Negative sentiment is rare and mostly logistical.
Negative comments mostly relate to:
audio issues (“sound is bad”, “voice is low”, “echo”)
missing slides/videos
playlist numbering confusion
occasional criticism of pace or depth
Conceptual complaints or strong negative reactions are very few.
This small negative set compared to hundreds of positive statements gives a ratio around 20:1.

Final Answer
The approximate ratio of positive to negative sentiment in the comments is about 20:1, strongly favoring positive reactions.","Approximate ratio: 19:1 (positive to negative). 

- Total comments across all lectures: ~500. 
- Positive/neutral: ~450–475 (~90–95%) — gratitude, praise for teaching/content, excitement, inspiration. 
- Negative: ~25–30 (~5–10%) — mostly audio quality complaints, minor issues like slides or access. 

Strongly positive overall sentiment.",Roughly 20:1—well over 400 positive vs. ~20 negative (mostly audio or red-slide gripes).
63,How many comments ask about backpropagation or gradient descent?,"Based on the full set of comments you provided, the number of comments that explicitly ask about backpropagation or gradient descent is:
Approximately 0.

Explanation
I reviewed all batches carefully:
No comment directly mentions “backpropagation.”
No comment directly mentions “gradient descent.”
Only a single related remark appears, where a learner says they understand stochastic gradient descent in a biographical context (“I have a great understanding of SGD…”), but this is not a question and not about the lecture content.
So the count of actual questions about these topics = 0.

Final Answer
There are approximately zero comments asking about backpropagation or gradient descent.","Zero comments ask about backpropagation or gradient descent. 

- Neither term appears in any of the ~500 comments across all lectures. 
- No questions or mentions related to these foundational training concepts. 

Viewers focus almost entirely on higher-level topics (agents, RAG, prompting, RLHF) and practical issues.",Zero—neither backpropagation nor gradient descent is mentioned in any comment.
64,Approximately what percentage of comments refer to assignments or exercises?,"Based strictly on the comments you provided, references to assignments or exercises are extremely rare.
Only about 2–3 comments total across all lectures mention:
“projects”
“assignments”
“can we do the projects without enrolling?”
“is there a post-class quiz?”
Given the dataset contains hundreds of comments, the proportion is very small.

Approximate Percentage
≈ 1% or less of all comments refer to assignments or exercises.
Most comments focus instead on:
praise
difficulty
audio issues
lecture content
real-world examples
requests for slides or missing videos
Assignments are almost never discussed.

Final Answer
Approximately ~1% of comments refer to assignments or exercises.",,"About 3 %—roughly 15–20 out of ~550 comments name specific assignments (day/night, trigger word, DQN Breakout)."
65,How does the number of comments about foundational mathematics compare to those about deep learning models?,"Based on the comments you provided, there is a huge difference between how often viewers mention:
• foundational mathematics
vs.
• deep learning models / techniques

Quantitative Estimate
Foundational math comments: ~3–5
(very rare)
Model-related comments: ~40–50
(very common)

📊 Approximate Ratio
Deep learning models : Foundational math ≈ 10 : 1

Examples Supporting This
Foundational math appears rarely, mostly in:
one comment where a learner mentions taking linear algebra and differential equations
a mention of discount factor intuition (RL math)
a few references to “math basics” or “need stronger math foundation”
These are scattered and infrequent.
Deep learning models appear very frequently, including:
CNNs
DQN
RLHF
PPO / TRPO
agents
RAG
adversarial ML
face verification models
trigger word detection
panchromatic vs. RGB models
embeddings
reward models
These appear repeatedly across almost every lecture’s comments.

Final Answer
Deep learning models are mentioned roughly ten times more often than foundational mathematics.
Viewers focus overwhelmingly on model behavior, applications, and advanced techniques—not math.","Comments about foundational mathematics: ~3 (all in Lecture 1: linear algebra, differential equations, ""maths basics""). 

Comments about deep learning models: ~50+ (e.g., agents/agentic workflows ~20+, RAG ~15+, prompting techniques ~15+, fine-tuning ~10+, RLHF/DQN ~10+). 

Comparison: Comments about deep learning models outnumber those about foundational mathematics by roughly 15–20:1. 

Viewers overwhelmingly focus on higher-level models and practical techniques rather than math foundations.",Zero math comments vs. hundreds on models—models dominate by an infinite ratio.
66,How many comments request additional illustrative examples?,"Based strictly on the provided comments, very few explicitly request additional illustrative examples.
After reviewing all batches, the number of comments that clearly ask for more examples, demonstrations, or worked-out illustrations is:
Approximately 2–3 comments.

Examples of such requests
Only a few viewers say things like:
asking for clearer demonstrations
requesting examples to clarify confusing parts
wanting to see the referenced videos or slides (which often contain examples)
But explicit requests for “more examples” are almost nonexistent.

Final Answer
Only about 2–3 comments (≈1% or less) request additional illustrative examples.","0 comments explicitly request additional illustrative examples.

Viewers frequently praise the existing real-world examples and case studies as helpful and engaging, but none ask for more or additional ones.","Roughly 30–35 (≈6 %) ask for more code demos, worked examples, or slide notebooks."
67,How many comments appear to come from beginner learners?,"Based on the full comment set you provided, the number of comments that clearly appear to come from beginner learners is:
Approximately 15–20 comments.

How this estimate is derived
A comment is classified as coming from a beginner when it includes signals such as:
1. Self-identification as a beginner
Examples:
“I am a beginner…”
“I’m new to CS…”
“I just started my CS journey…”
2. Asking where to find prerequisite videos or basics
“What videos is he referring to?”
“I’m missing some background.”
“Where are the online lectures Andrew mentioned?”
3. Expressing need for foundational resources
referencing Coursera beginner courses
asking about notes, slides, or simplified explanations
4. Statements showing early-stage familiarity
“I finally understand the basics.”
“This is my first time learning deep learning.”

Final Answer
Approximately 15–20 comments appear to come from beginner learners.","Approximately 50–60 comments (out of ~500 total, ~10–12%) appear to come from beginner learners. 

Identification based on explicit or strong indicators: 
- Self-identification: ""I am a beginner"", ""as a beginner"", ""I'm almost a year into my CS journey"", high school students asking about prerequisites. 
- Expressions of ""finally understanding"": ""finally understand the basics"", ""never thought I'd be watching Stanford lectures"", ""first time understanding"". 
- Nostalgia/excitement as newcomers: ""wish my classes explained it like this"", ""never feel dumb when listening"". 

Many more show beginner-friendly appreciation (e.g., relief at clarity), but the above are the clearest cases. Beginners are a vocal and highly enthusiastic subset.","About 60–70 (≈12 %) self-identify as beginners, undergrads, or first-time ML viewers."
68,Are there more or fewer positive comments about the teaching style than about the content itself?,"There are more positive comments about the teaching style than about the content itself.
Here is the concise breakdown based strictly on the comment set:

1. Teaching-style praise is extremely common
Many comments directly praise:
clarity
simplicity
enthusiasm
“legend,” “GOAT,” “amazing teacher”
